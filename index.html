        <h2>üìú Philosophy of space</h2>
        <p>
          Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of
          space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of
          Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called kh√¥ra
          (i.e. "space"), or in the Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the
          definition of topos (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical
          conception of place" as "space qua extension" in the Discourse on
          Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen.[4]
          Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the
          Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly
          during the early development of classical mechanics.

        <p>
          Isaac Newton viewed space as absolute, existing permanently and
          independently of whether there was any matter in the.[5] In contrast,
          other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought that
          space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by
          their distance and direction from one another. In the 18th century,
          the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the
          "visibility of spatial depth" in his Essay Towards a New Theory of
          Vision. Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts
          of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of
          the outside world‚Äîthey are elements of an already given systematic
          framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences.
          Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his Critique of Pure
          Reason as being a subjective "pure a priori form of intuition".

          Galilean and Cartesian theories about space, matter, and motion are at
          the foundation of the Scientific Revolution, which is understood to
          have culminated with the publication of Newton's Principia Mathematica
          in 1687.[6] Newton's theories about space and time helped him explain
          the movement of objects. While his theory of space is considered the
          most influential in physics, it emerged from his predecessors' ideas
          about the same.[

        <p>
          In modern mathematics spaces are defined as sets with some added
          structure. They are typically topological spaces, in which a concept
          of neighbourhood is defined, frequently by means of a distance (metric
          spaces). The elements of a space are often called points, but they can
          have other names such as vectors in vector spaces and functions in
          function spaces.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Physics</h2>

        <p>
          Space is one of the few fundamental quantities in physics, meaning
          that it cannot be defined via other quantities because nothing more
          fundamental is known at the present. On the other hand, it can be
          related to other fundamental quantities. Thus, similar to other
          fundamental quantities (like time and mass), space can be explored via
          measurement and experiment. Today, our three-dimensional space is
          viewed as embedded in a four-dimensional spacetime, called Minkowski
          space (see special relativity). The idea behind spacetime is that time
          is hyperbolic-orthogonal to each of the three spatial dimensions.

        <h3>Relativity</h3>
        <p>
          Before Albert Einstein's work on relativistic physics, time and space
          were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's discoveries showed
          that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be
          mathematically combined into one object‚Äìspacetime. It turns out that
          distances in space or in time separately are not invariant with
          respect to Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in
          Minkowski space along spacetime intervals are‚Äîwhich justifies the
          name. In addition, time and space dimensions should not be viewed as
          exactly equivalent in Minkowski space. One can freely move in space
          but not in time. Thus, time and space coordinates are treated
          differently both in special relativity (where time is sometimes
          considered an imaginary coordinate) and in general relativity (where
          different signs are assigned to time and space components of spacetime
          metric).
        </p>
        <h3>Cosmology</h3>
        <p>
          Relativity theory leads to the cosmological question of what shape the
          universe is, and where space came from. It appears that space was
          created in the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago[30] and has been
          expanding ever since. The overall shape of space is not known, but
          space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the cosmic
          inflation.
        </p>
        <h3>Spatial measurement</h3>
        <p>
          The measurement of physical space has long been important. Although
          earlier societies had developed measuring systems, the International
          System of Units, (SI), is now the most common system of units used in
          the measuring of space, and is almost universally used. Currently, the
          standard space interval, called a standard meter or simply meter, is
          defined as the distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time
          interval of exactly 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition coupled
          with present definition of the second is based on the special theory
          of relativity in which the speed of light plays the role of a
          fundamental constant of nature.
